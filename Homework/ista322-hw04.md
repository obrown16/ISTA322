2. Using the object initializer syntax is a shortcut that avoids several explicit steps. List the steps that
the use of object initializers avoids. pg 72
Create a new object, set the property values

3. What is the purpose of creating extension methods?
used to add methods to classes that you do not own and cannot modify directly.

4. What is the one feature of extension methods that will always allow you to identify a method as an
extension method? The This keyword


5. How do you create an extension method that filters the results returned by the method on a user
specified criterion?
use the yield keyword

6. Explain the syntax of a lambda expression. The term “lambda expression” originates in the lambda
calculus developed by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930’s. There is a class of programming

Its an anonymous function. 

7. This will require some outside research. What is the distinction between an anonmously typed variable
and a dynamically typed variable?

8. You are having a discussion about C# with a friend of yours that uses another language. You are
tellig him about C#’s LINQ library. How would you describe to him the difference between LINQ’s
SQL-like notation and LINQ’s dot notation?

9. What, exactly, does the await keyword do?
tells the compiler that I want ot wait for the result of the Task that a specified method returns and then carry on executing other statements.

10. What is the connection between await and the async keywords?
used together they allow a more natural syntax, but do not change what is happending in the methods to which they are applied.
